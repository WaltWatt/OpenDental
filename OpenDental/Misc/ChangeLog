    * ClassConvertDatabase.cs: 
        - Rewrote the ExecuteFile function to always prefix the file name with "ConversionFiles", avoiding the need to repeat this in every call. 
        - Used Path.Combine instead of backslashes in directory names
        - Removed some comments to make the file more readable
        - Rewrote the ExecuteFile function to make use of File.ReadAllText. This simplifies the ExecuteFile function logic.
