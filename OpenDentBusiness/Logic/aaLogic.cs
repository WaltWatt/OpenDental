//Classes in this Logic folder typically end in "Logic" rather than s.  They contain business logic that does not belong in the UI.  They cannot contain any queries.  If the logic needs access to the database, then it must be in the DataInterface folder instead.  Classes in this folder can use local Cache without any problems.  There might not end up being very many files in here by the time we are done.
