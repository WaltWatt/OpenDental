//"files" table hasn't been used for quite some time.  We are leaving it in the database in case a user from a very old version has some important data in it.  As time goes by, that seems less and less likely.

//This functionality has been replaced by additional columns in the document table.  It is planned to add columns to other tables as needed, including claimattach, emailattach, and sheetfield.
