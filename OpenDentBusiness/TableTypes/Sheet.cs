/*A better name for this object would be a Form, but that name is obviously too ambiguous and has been overused.  There are two different aspects of the database tables:
	1. Customization of sheets.
	2. Saving data filled in on sheets.
	Sheets do not include reports, which are better handled by the RDL framework or something even simpler.  Examples of what sheets might be used for include statements, tx plans, rx, lab slips, postcards, referral slips, patient registration forms, medical histories, consent forms, and labels.
	The interesting thing about this framework is that it is able to support incoming data as well as outgoing data using the following elements:
	-background image
	-static text
	-text generated from database
	-user input
	Class names:
	Data: Sheet, SheetField. (Parameters are saved as part of fields, except PatNum is part of Sheet)
	Defs:	SheetDef, SheetFieldDef (SheetParameters are hardcoded based on type)
  SheetImage (handling this with files for now)
	
	Note that we have tried to do similar things before, but not with as much clarity and organization.  See the ReportingOld2 folder for an example of a similar framework that never took off because:
	a) It was overwhelming because it was trying to handle 'reporting' functions as its main purpose.
	b) It did not start with a simpler framework and build iteratively.
	c) It was modeled after Crystal Reports, which was only designed for reports, not forms.
	d) We did not have generics.
