Examples of cognitive problem observations are inability to recall, amnesia, dementia, and aggressive behavior. A cognitive problem observation is a finding or medical condition. This is different from a cognitive result observation, which is a response to a question that provides insight to the patient's cognitive status. It reflects findings that provide information about a medical condition, while a result observation reflects responses to questions in a cognitive test or those that provide information about a person's judgement, comprehension ability, and response speed.</summary>

The evaluation may include assessment of a patient's  language, vision, hearing, activities of daily living, behavior, general function, mobility and self-care status. The statement will include, if present, supporting caregivers, non-medical devices, and the time period for which the evaluation and assessment were performed.</summary>
