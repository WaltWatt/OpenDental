This directory contains the tools required to package Open Dental on Debian and Ubuntu Linux.

The packaging is controlled by the scripts in the scripts/ directory:
* scripts/package-mono
  builds packages that install Mono on Debian and Ubuntu Linux. They are taken from the Debian
  SVN repository that can be found at http://pkg-mono.alioth.debian.org/. The modifications made
  were:
  - Support Mono 1.2.3.50 (main reason for packaging).
  - Support Debian Sarge (version 3.1), the current stable version of Debian GNU/Linux.
    Support for such an old version of Linux (released in 2005 and ships with kernel 2.4)
    is possible because of the low requirements that Mono set.

* scripts/package-opendental
  This will build Debian packages for Open Dental. 

* scripts/make-iso
  Creates an iso image of a cd containing the packages required to install Open Dental. 

* scripts/publish
  Publishes packages from the packages directory to the repository and download folder.

NOTE: Do not run these scripts as root!

These scripts assume the following layout:
* ~/sources
  Contains a working copy of the sources for mono, mcs, libgdiplus and opendental.
  Created if it doesn't exist.

* ~/packaging
  Directory used to package sources. The sources are downloaded (be it from the web or subversion)
  and then Debian packages are build

* ~/packages
  When built, the packages will eventualy end up in the ~/packages directory. From here, they will
  be published to the repository

* ~/repository
  A directory containing the repository for Open Dental

* ~/download
  A directory containing files for direct, public download

You'll need to have some tools installed:
* Subversion (apt-get install subversion)
* svn-buildpackage (apt-get install svn-buildpackage)
* gawk (apt-get install gawk)
* A recent version of maketools. Debian Sarge comes with maketools1.4, maketools1.9 is required.
  To see which version you are using:
    automake --version
  To install the latest version:
    sudo apt-get install automake1.9
    sudo apt-get remove automake1.4
  (it is very important to remove automake 1.4)
* and the usual packages required for building Debian packages

The scripts should be documented clearly, refer to them for more information.
